## Codebase

### File Structure
- `streamlit_app.py`: Main Streamlit application file, handles the UI and integrates with backend services.
- `openai_utils.py`: Utility functions for interacting with Azure OpenAI's GPT model, including functions for solving optimization problems.
- `azure_blob_utils.py`: Utility functions for interacting with Azure Blob Storage, including functions for logging user interactions.

## Dependencies

The project relies on several key libraries and services:

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Azure OpenAI**: For natural language processing and generating solutions.
- **Azure Storage**: For storing logs and user interaction data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and logging.

### Required Python Packages
- `azure-storage-blob`
- `langchain`
- `langchain_core`
- `langchain_experimental`
- `langchain_openai`
- `pandas`
- `python-dotenv`
- `streamlit`

## Environment Configurations

To run the application, you'll need to set up environment variables and configuration files. Key configurations include:

- **Azure OpenAI API Credentials**: Store in '.env' for secure access.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Connection strings and container names are also stored in `st.secrets`.

### Sample `.env` File
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = ""
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = ""
api_version = ""
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME = ""
AZURE_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME = ""
```env

## Input Data

The application expects the following inputs from the user:

1. **Problem Statement**: A detailed description of the optimization problem to be solved. This should include the context and any relevant background information.
2. **Objective to Solve**: The specific goal or outcome that the optimization process aims to achieve. This could be minimizing costs, maximizing efficiency, etc.
3. **Constraints**: Any limitations or conditions that must be adhered to while solving the optimization problem. This may include resource limits, deadlines, or other operational constraints.

### Example Input
```markdown
**Problem Statement:** 
Optimize the supply chain logistics for a manufacturing company to minimize total transportation costs while meeting delivery deadlines.

**Objective to Solve:** 
Minimize the total transportation cost across all supply routes.

**Constraints:** 
- Each supplier can only supply a maximum of 1000 units.
- The delivery deadline for all orders is within 5 days.
- Transportation capacity for each route is limited to 500 units per day.

**Solution:**
- Optimal solution to the question.
